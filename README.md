## Reason for rewrite

The decision to switch from Qt to Electron with React was primarily driven by two factors.

Firstly, Qt was too heavy to install, which made it challenging for users to set up and use the ticket printer software. Electron, on the other hand, provides a "lightweight" and easy-to-install framework, making it more accessible for users.

Secondly, the previous version of the ticket printer only worked on Linux, which required the Student Association to keep specific computers dedicated to running the software. By adopting Electron with React, the ticket printer can now run on multiple platforms, including Windows and macOS, eliminating the need for separate hardware setups.

Overall, the switch to Electron with React improved the installation experience and expanded the software's compatibility, making it more convenient and versatile for users.
